# Town Pages Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented clickable town links on the Ayrshire page that navigate to individual town landing pages for each Ayrshire town.

## Implementation

### 1. Made Towns Clickable

**File**: `src/pages/LocationAyrshire.tsx`

✅ Updated the town grid to use `Link` components  
✅ Each town now links to `/locations/{town}` where town is lowercase  
✅ Added hover effect on town cards (`hover:shadow-md`)  
✅ Maintains the same visual design  

### 2. Created Dynamic Town Page Component

**File**: `src/pages/LocationTown.tsx` (NEW)

✅ **Dynamic Route Handling**: Uses `useParams` to get the town name from URL  
✅ **Capitalization**: Automatically capitalizes town name for display  
✅ **Location-Specific Hero**: Passes town name to Hero component for localized headline  
✅ **Dynamic Meta Tags**: 
- Title: "Web Design & Local SEO in {Town} | CodaPixel"
- Description: Town-specific SEO description
- Canonical: Proper town URL

✅ **Same Structure as Ayrshire Page**:
- Header
- Hero component with town name
- HomeServices component
- HomeContact component
- Footer

### 3. Updated Routing

**File**: `src/App.tsx`

✅ Added import for `LocationTown` component  
✅ Added route: `/locations/:town` - matches any town name  
✅ Positioned after specific Ayrshire route to avoid conflicts  

### 4. Updated Sitemap

**File**: `public/sitemap.xml`

✅ Added individual town URLs:
- `/locations/ayr`
- `/locations/prestwick`
- `/locations/troon`
- `/locations/kilmarnock`
- `/locations/irvine`
- `/locations/mauchline`
- `/locations/maybole`
- `/locations/girvan`

✅ All set to:

- Priority: 0.8
- Lastmod: 2025-01-15

## Towns Implemented

1. Ayr - `/locations/ayr`
2. Prestwick - `/locations/prestwick`
3. Troon - `/locations/troon`
4. Kilmarnock - `/locations/kilmarnock`
5. Irvine - `/locations/irvine`
6. Mauchline - `/locations/mauchline`
7. Maybole - `/locations/maybole`
8. Girvan - `/locations/girvan`

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Route Pattern

The route uses a parameter `:town` which matches any lowercase town name:
```
/locations/:town → /locations/ayr, /locations/prestwick, etc.
```

### Hero Component Update

The Hero component now accepts a `location` prop:
- When `location="Ayrshire"` → Shows "Web Design & Local SEO for Ayrshire Businesses"
- When `location="Ayr"` → Shows "Web Design & Local SEO for Ayr Businesses"
- When no location → Shows default "Websites that generate clients - from just £79/month"

### Capitalization Logic

The LocationTown component automatically capitalizes the town name:
- URL: `/locations/ayr` → Display: "Ayr"
- URL: `/locations/prestwick` → Display: "Prestwick"

This handles the mismatch between lowercase URLs and proper case display.

## SEO Benefits

✅ **Hyperlocal Landing Pages**: Each town gets its own dedicated page  
✅ **Location-Specific Keywords**: "Web Design in Ayr", "SEO in Prestwick", etc.  
✅ **Sitemap Inclusion**: All town pages in sitemap for indexing  
✅ **Meta Tag Optimization**: Unique title and description per town  
✅ **Canonical URLs**: Proper canonical tags for each town  
✅ **Consistent Content**: All town pages have full homepage content  

## User Experience

✅ **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear clickable town cards  
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects on town cards  
✅ **Consistent Experience**: All town pages match the main site structure  
✅ **Easy Booking**: Calendly widget on every town page  
✅ **Local Relevance**: Town-specific headlines and messaging
