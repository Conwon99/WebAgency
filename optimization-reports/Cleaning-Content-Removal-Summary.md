**Updated in**:
- Footer (top and bottom)
- HomeContact component
- Hero component (WhatsApp links)
- Schema markup (index.html)

## Remaining "Cleaning" References

The following are **intentional** and **not cleaning-related content**:

### CSS Design Tokens
Classes like `bg-cleaning-background`, `text-cleaning-text`, etc. are design system tokens that define the site's color palette. Renaming these would require a full refactor across all files and is not necessary.

**Example**: `bg-cleaning-background` = `#F7F9FC` (light background color)
- This is just a naming convention from the original template
- The colors themselves are appropriate for any business
- No visible "cleaning" terminology appears in the UI

### Unused Components
The following components contain cleaning content but are **NOT being used** on any page:
- `src/components/Process.tsx` - Not imported anywhere
- `src/components/HomeProcess.tsx` - Not imported anywhere
- `src/components/Services.tsx` - Not imported (different from `src/pages/Services.tsx`)
- `src/components/BeforeAfterGallery.tsx` - Not imported anywhere

These can be safely ignored or deleted in the future if desired.
